\label{sec:creationLattice}

To be precise, we will not create lattice according to the definition given in sectio~\ref{sec:brav_latt}, 
as this would require the creation of sets with infinite elements. Clearly, a GNN can only deal with finitely many nodes.
Hence, we will only create finite subsets of lattice but, for sake of simplicity, we will still call them lattices.

Let us start with the creation of two-dimensional lattices.
Choose $a,b\in\R_+$, $\phi\in(0,\pi)$ and set
$e_x=(0,a)^T,\,e_y=(b\cos(\phi), b\sin(\phi))^T$ (for visulaization ogf $a,b$ and $\theta$, see figure~\ref{fig:bravais2D}). 
Then, the set $\tilde{\Omega}=\Z e_x\times\Z e_y\subset\R^2$ is a two-dimensional lattice.
As mentioned, we only work with finite subsets of $\Omega$. Hence, we choose $N_x,N_y\in\N$ and set $\Omega=\N_{\leq N_x}e_x\times\N_{\leq N_y}e_y\subset\tilde{\Omega}$.
This lattice now has $N_xN_y$ elements.
Next, we add some noise to the elements in $\Omega$ and restrict their coordinates to a certain range. For this instance, let $\mu,\sigma,s\in\R_+$ and draw random samples from
a normal distribution with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Secondly, we scale these random numbers by the factor $s$ 
and add the scaled noise to all elements in $\Omega$ (component-wise, i.e. add noise to the first coordinate of the elements in $\Omega$ as well as to the second coordinate).
Restricting all coordinates to a certain range is simply done. Let $x_{max}, y_{max}\in\R_+$ and replace each $(x,y)\in\Omega$ with $(x \mod x_{max}, y \mod y_{max})$ 
Next, we want to turn our lattice $\Omega$ into a graph $(V,E)$. Obviously, we can set $V=\Omega$ and what remains is the choice of edges. For this, we take $r\in\R_+$ and set
\begin{equation*}
    E=\{(v, w)\in V\times V: \norm{v-w}<r\},
\end{equation*}
where $\norm{\cdot}$ denotes the standard norm in $R^d$, i.e. nodes that are close together will be connected.
Lastly, we choose $p_n,p_e\in[0,1]$ and randomly delete nodes with probability $p_n$ (and edges with probability $p_e$ respectively).

The creation of three-dimensional lattices is completely analogously. The only difference is that we have to pick three basis vectors $e_x,e_y,e_z$ which have length $a,b,c\in\R_+$ and 
enclose angles $\phi=\angle(e_x, e_y),\,\psi=\angle(e_x,e_z),\,\chi=\angle(e_y,e_z)$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:examplesLattices} shows two different lattices created by the above procedure.

According to the above procdeure, we are able, to generate training and test datasets for our GNN, both in 2d and in 3d.
We start with a quick describition of the 2d-dataset. 
First, epending on the specific values of $a,b$ and $\theta$, different graphs for different Bravais classes can be generated 
(take again a look at figure~\ref{fig:bravais2D} as a reminder, which values of $a,b,\theta$ result in which Bravais class).
Recall, that in some cases $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ is required. In order to introduce a bit artifical noise, we allow for values
in the range $(0.99\frac{\pi}{2}, 1.01\frac{\pi}{2})$.
Accordingly, when the side lengths are required to fullfill $a=b$, we allow for deviations of $1\%$, 
i.e. such that $0.99\leq\frac{a}{b}\leq1.01$.
Furthermore, we set the minimal side length to be 0.1 and the maximal side length to be 10. 
The parameters determining the above mentioned noise, where chosen to be $\sigma=0.5,\mu=0$. The amplitude of
the noise in x-direction was taken to be $s=0.07a$ (depeneding on the side-length $a$) as well as $s=0.07b$
in y-direction. The probabilities $p_n,p_e$ for randomly droping nodes/edges were taken to be $p_n=p_e=0.01$
According to these rules, we created 10000 graphs per Bravais class. Since there are 5 Bravais classes in total, the
2d-dataset consists of 50000 graphs, $20\%$ were taken to be the test set and the remaining $80\%4 $ constitute the training set.
