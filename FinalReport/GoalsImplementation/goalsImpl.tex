\label{sec:goalsImpl}

The project can be split into two parts. The goal of the first part is to build a GNN that is capable of assigning a 2- or 3-dimensional lattice its Bravais class. 
For this instance, different lattices need to be created programmatically. This will be covered in the first part of this chapter. The second part describes the actual implementation of the GNN.
In the second part of the project, we will take a look at more complex structures. The goal is to distinguish between percolating and non-percolating graphs.
