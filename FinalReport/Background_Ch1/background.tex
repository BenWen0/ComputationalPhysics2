This introductory section lays the theoretical foundation of Bravais lattices and GNNs. 
We start with a short recap of lattice structures in two and three dimensions and then continue with 
the most fundamental background of Neural Networks (NNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Results on Bravais lattices can be found in many textbooks. Subsection~\ref{sec:brav_latt} follows \cite{Schwarzenberger} and \cite{symGroupsApplications}.
An introduction to NNs and GNNs can be found for example in \cite{bookNN1}, \cite{bookNN2} and in~\cite{IntroMessagePassing}
which are also the main reference for section~\ref{sec:intro_nn} and section~\ref{sec:fund_gnns}.
