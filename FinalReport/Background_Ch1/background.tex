This introductory section lays the theoretical foundation of Bravais lattices and GNNs. 
We start with a short recap of lattice structures in 2d and 3d and then continue with 
the most fundamental background of Graph-Neural Networks (GNN). 
Results on Bravais lattices can be found in many textbooks. Subsection~\ref{sec:brav_latt} follows~\cite{Schwarzenberger} and ~\cite{symGroupsApplications}.
Introduction to Graph Neural Networks can be found for example in~\cite{IntroMessagePassing} which is also the main reference for section~\ref{sec:fund_gnns}.
