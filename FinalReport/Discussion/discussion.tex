This chapter presents the results of the problems mentioned in chapter~\ref{sec:goalsImpl}.
Furthermore, we are going to analyze these results. As in chapter~\ref{sec:goalsImpl}, we start
by looking at the classification tasks in 2 and 3 dimensions and after that, we will proceed with the percolation problem.
