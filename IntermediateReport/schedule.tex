The first goal mentioned in the previous section has already been achieved. 
The 2d and 3d lattice-generation is finished and some different GNN structures have already been tested and evaluated.
Both, in 2d and in 3d, an accuracy of about 90\% have been achieved but probably with further testing, the accuracy can be increased even more.
Until end of December further experiments with the network structure is planned. 
The second goal mentioned in the previous section has not yet been achieved. The code for this is planned to be finished until begin of January.
The final results are then expected until mid January so that the final report can be written in the last two weeks of January.
