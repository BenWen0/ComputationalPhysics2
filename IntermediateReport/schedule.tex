The first goal mentioned in the previous section has already been achieved. 
The 2d and 3d lattice-generation is finished and some different GNN structures have already been tested and evaluated.
Both, in 2d and in 3d, an accuracy of about 90\% has been achieved but probably with further testing, the accuracy can be increased even more.
By the end of December further experiments with the network structure are planned. 
The second goal mentioned in the previous section has not been achieved yet. The code for this is planned to be finished by the beginning of January.
The final results are then expected by mid-January so that the report can be written in the last two weeks of January.
