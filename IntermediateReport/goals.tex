The project can be split into two parts. The goal of the first part is to build a GNN that is capabale of assigning a 2- or 3-dimentional lattices its Bravais class. 
For this instance, different lattices needs to be created programmatically. Furthermore, they have to be labeled so that they can serve as training data.
Once we have a good amount of training data at hand we need to determine the optimal structure of the GNN. This amounts to finding the
right functions $\phi,\psi$ in equation xy and to determine which edge-/node-features do best.
In the second part of the project, we will take a look at more complex structures. getting familiar with basic gnn techniques
