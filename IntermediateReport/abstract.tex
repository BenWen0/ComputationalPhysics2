The project lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and solid-state physics. 
A common task in solid-state physics is the classification of atomic structures, for example in crystals.
Machine Learning on the other hand is well known for its ability in classification tasks. Combining these two worlds provides a powerful tool for 
classifying different crystal-structures. 
As crystal structures are described by the so called Bravais lattices, which closely relate to graphs, we will need machine learning tools capable of properly handling graph-like data.
Fortunately, in the last few years, a new type of neural networks, exactly designed for this kind of data, emerged: Graph-Neural-Networks.
The overall goal of this project is to get familiar with GNNs and apply to them to classification tasks of Bravais lattices.
