\textbf{What we have learned:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GNN capable of classifying Bravais lattices
    \item Correlation between width, depth and accuracies rather complicated
    \item Connection problem can not be solved\par$\implies$percolation problem can not be solved
\end{itemize}
\textbf{What can be done next:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bravais lattices: vary node, edge features
    \item Percolation Problem: experiment with layers that preserve topological properties
\end{itemize}
